UCSDCollegeTickrAndroid
=======================
This is a WIP android application for Collegetickr.com

Currently, the layout will mimic a cross between the Facebook app and Facebook Paper.

ToDo List:
Add in touch to dismiss while edittext is focused
Test out api calls and see if the progress dialogs work during asynctask
Add in logic for having progress pending fragments
Reorganize so that we can support multiple campuses
Add in constructors so we can add not only confessions but other applications for application calls

Secondary
Create class to hold variables that change the window size based on screen size/android device.
